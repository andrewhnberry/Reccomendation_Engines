# Reccomendation_Engines
 Personal repository in exploring reccomendation engines

This will a collection of various reccomendation engines that I will attempt to build as I study this field of data science.

This won't be limited to just one engine and one dataset, but it will comprise a few. 

I've already started with one, the movie reccomendation engine with a movie dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv
